Our Lab has a broad interest in Plant Ecology ranging from Ecosystem ecology to Community ecology including Biodiversity and Conservation. We are particularly interested in how current rates of climate change will affect the soil ecosystem functioning (especially Cycling of Nutrients like Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorus) and Plant diversity. We study Soil ecosystem processes, Nutrient cycling and Plant diversity to predict the possible impacts of future Climate Change in Shivalik Landscape. Currently we are working on importance of plant diversity Carbon, Nitrogen and Phosphorus cycling in Siwalik Himalayan Landscape of Northwest India.
