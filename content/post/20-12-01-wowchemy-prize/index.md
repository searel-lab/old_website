Our team member Abhishek Kumar presented a research poster titled Plant response to Climate change: Herbarium can act as a tool for future research on plant-climate interactions at Second National Conference on Climate Change: Agricuture, Biodiversity and Human Health organised by the Clean and Green Environmental Society (CGES), Lucknow and CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI), Lucknow on February 22-23, 2020 held at CSIR-NBRI, Lucknow. This reserch poster has been awarded Third Prize. In this study, the authors have evaluated the temporal changes in leaf morphological traits using herbarium specimens. We found temporal changes mainly in 3 parameters of leaf morphological traits (i.e. leaf area, leaf length and leaf shape) of the grasses except leaf width. The increase in leaf area was correlated with the average atmospheric CO2 concentration of the year in which a particular species was collected. In conclusion, we found that plants are already responding to changing environmental conditions that evidently observed in the herbarium specimens. Therefore, herbarium can prove to be a good tool to understand plant-climate interactions in future studies.
Abhishek Kumar thanked his collegues and co-authors for support and construvtive suggestions during the research work.
